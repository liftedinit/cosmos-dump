```

## Commands

- `extract` - Extracts blockchain data to JSON files.
- `export-tsv` - Export extracted blockchain data to TSV files.

### Extract Command

- `-s`, `--start` - The starting block height to extract data from (default: 1)
- `-e`, `--stop` - The stopping block height to extract data from (default: 1)
